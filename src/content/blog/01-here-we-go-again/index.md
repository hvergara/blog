Starting my blog again feels both familiar and refreshing. I first started blogging over 20 years ago, back in 2000, when the internet was friendlier and less complex. Personal websites were much simpler, and blogging was just beginning to take off. 

Since then, the world and the web have evolved significantly, but the desire to connect remains strong. I feel a need to fill the gap left by Twitter, where I not only met some of my closest friends and my life partner but also encountered inspiring individuals who have shaped what I am today.

I'm not sure what will come from this endevour, but I'm confident something interesting will emerge from here. A new opportunity for self-expression and experimentation. 

I'm ready to re-start. Are you?
